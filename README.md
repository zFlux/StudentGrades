# StudentGrades
This is a bare bones Spring Boot application to demonstrate database persistence via a web service.

1. Download this source into STS or eclipse as a maven project
2. Download HSQL (http://hsqldb.org/). 
3. Run the create table commands from the setup folder against the default HSQL database server
4. POST the example JSON from the examples folder to localhost:8080/student_records (using Content-Type: application/json)
5. Play around and modify this example
